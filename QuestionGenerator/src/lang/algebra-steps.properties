lv1add = Add 
lv1tobothtoremove = to both sides to remove -
lv1subtract = Subtract 
lv1frombothtoremove = from both sides to remove
lv1divboth = Divide both sides by 
lv1rmvmult = to remove the multiplier
lv1multboth = Multiply both sides by 
lv1rmvdiv = to remove the divisor 
lv1simp = Perform simple arithmetic equation on both sides, 
lv1solv = is solved
